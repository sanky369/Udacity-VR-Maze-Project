# Udacity-VR-Maze-Project
This is my fourth project of Udacity VR Nanodegree. Built a VR application using Unity and the Google VR SDK where the user explores a maze environment to demonstrate working knowledge of 2D and 3D UI, waypoint based navigation, procedural animation, interactive objects, spatial audio, particle effects and persistent storage of session data.
